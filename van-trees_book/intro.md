# Welcome to Daniel Stevens' Jupyter Book 

This books was created for Assignment 8 of the UBC Extended Learning course 'The Data Science Toolbox' which is part of the Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate Program. This is the capstone project for the course; its production incorporates concepts learned throughout the course's 8 modules.

'The Data Science Toolbox' course materials for can be found [here](https://toolbox-learn.mds.ubc.ca/).

Content for this book is derived from the capstone project produced in the UBC Extended Learning course 'Data Visualization' which is also part of Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate Program. The project explores and analyzes the composition of the Vancouver street tree population at the species level using the satistical visualization library Altair. It attempts to glean insights pertaining to tree stewardship as it relates to the City of Vancouver's climate adaptation strategy.

Thank you for taking a look at my book. I hope both its structure and content prove to be inspirational to those looking to develop their data science skills.
