# Introduction

The first step in any data analysis process is to explore the data. To do this, we will use a combination of the Pandas library which allows exploration through manipulation of paneled data, and Altair, which is a library used for statistical data visualization. To obtain a rough outline of our formal analysis, we will be exploring the following questions:

[](question_1) How do the various genera in the Vancouver street tree population rank in relation to one another in terms of importance to the total population?

[](question_2) How does the range in tree diameter contribute to the relative importance of each genera and is there a difference between them? 

[](question_3) How do Vancouver neighbourhoods compare in terms of importance value density of the street tree population?

[](question_4) How is the relative importance of each genus distributed throughout Vancouver?
