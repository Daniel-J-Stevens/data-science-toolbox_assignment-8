# The Data Science Toolbox- Assignment 8- Daniel Stevens

```{margin} What is the Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate Program?
The Key Capabilities in Data Science Program builds foundational python coding skills to teach core data science principles and techniques using various python libraries such as Pandas, Altair and SciKit-learn.
```
```{margin} What is the Data Science Toolbox course?
The Data Science Toolbox course aims to teach students how to use core data science tools. Students learn how to work in the shell using Bash scripting, version control and project collaboration using Git and GitHub, proper file naming conventions and project organization, how to install data science software and maintain virtual environments using the conda package manager and how to create and publish data science content using Markdown and Jupyter Books.

Content for this book is derived from the capstone project produced in the UBC Extended Learning course 'Data Visualization' which is also part of Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate Program [](street-trees-exp), [](street-trees-analysis). The project explores and analyzes the composition of the Vancouver street tree population at the genus level using the statistical visualization library Altair. It attempts to glean insights pertaining to tree stewardship as it relates to the City of Vancouver's climate adaptation strategy.
